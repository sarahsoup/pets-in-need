Meet Ambrosia.  After she’s gotten some of her energy out, she enjoys training games that provide mental and physical enrichment.  She’s not a big snuggler — don’t take it personally, but she does enjoy being brushed and massaged when she’s in the right mood.  Because our girl becomes easily overexcited, she has a tendency to overwhelm inexperienced handlers. For this reason, we’re looking for a very dog-savvy adopter with consistency and above average dog-training ability.  Does this sound like you?  Please call us.  Ambrosia needs a real home — she has been patiently waiting for you for way too long."""
