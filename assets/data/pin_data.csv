Meet Ambrosia.  After she’s gotten some of her energy out, she enjoys training games that provide mental and physical enrichment.  She’s not a big snuggler — don’t take it personally, but she does enjoy being brushed and massaged when she’s in the right mood.  We’re looking for a very dog-savvy adopter with consistency and above average dog-training ability.  Does this sound like you?  Please call us.

Now, we know the word ""energetic"" might turn potential adopters away, but we have a solution! One of Skippy's fave activities is heading out to the yard and trying to fetch as many tennis balls as he can in 20 minutes. He's always trying to break his personal record and that will tire him out pretty quickly. After fetch, he will gratefully snuggle on the couch with his humans.

The noise, strangers, and living next door to other cats all made Catelyn pretty cranky. Luckily, a woman came by the shelter looking to see if she can help an unfriendly cat blossom.

For Donica, once she became overstimulated, she would communicate her feelings with a nip at the hand closest to her. We quickly realized that Donica is the not the right fit for families looking for a cuddly cat. Because families who are looking for a withdrawn housemate are few and far between, placing Donica in a home was a challenge. By a stroke of luck, at the start of 2019, a couple visited our shelter, met Donica, and decided she would be a great addition to their family.

Our staff observed him as an easy-to-adopt dog who was overlooked because of his looks. As a bald, grey chihuahhua, he didn't capture the attention of adopters who were in search for fluffy, cuddly-looking dogs. He also didn't seem to be the most chummy guy, rarely approaching humans and only tolerating other dogs. Fortunately, after 6 months in our shelter, Zeus found a family who accepted him just as he is.
